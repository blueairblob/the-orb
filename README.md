# The Orb

An **audio-first, AI-narrated roleplay engine** — showcased through a family-friendly fantasy
escape adventure, but the real product is the reusable engine underneath.

> **The one-liner:** an interactive podcast — you listen, you speak, the story answers.
> Hands-free, eyes-free. Playable on a commute, a dog walk, or whilst chopping onions.

The engine is a **harness**: it constrains a general-purpose model down into a specific,
reliable, bounded role. Conventional game code owns the world's *brain* (state, rules, memory);
the LLM owns only its *mouth* (the words). That split is the whole idea.

---

## Status

**Design-complete, nothing built yet.** The PRD passed its own exit test (§22): new problems now
fold into old ones rather than multiplying, which is the signal to stop designing and start
building.

The **one piece of genuine uncertainty** is the hardware spike (§0) — does a small model run
acceptably on a warm mid-range Android phone? Everything else is engineering. **Nothing starts
until the spike returns an answer.**

Current decisions locked:

- **Spike benchmark model: Gemma 4 E2B** (`litert-community/gemma-4-E2B-it-litert-lm`, `.litertlm`).
- **Prototype language: Python**, desktop-first. The phone shell is a deliberately separate,
  later phase.
- **World model: build fresh, not on Evennia.** Evaluated hands-on and declined — its object
  model is inseparable from a Django+Twisted multiplayer server stack. See
  [ADR 0002](docs/decisions/0002-evennia-evaluation.md).

## Repo map

| Path | What's here |
|---|---|
| `docs/PRD.md` | **The canonical PRD (v0.8).** Single source of truth. Read this first. |
| `docs/decisions/` | Architecture Decision Records — one file per locked decision. |
| `docs/archive/` | Superseded working docs (e.g. the completed cleanup action plan). |
| `spike/` | The go/no-go hardware benchmark. `spike/README.md` defines the pass mark and how to log results. |
| `engine/` | Phase 1 Python engine (object model, state machine, brief-builder, voice loop). Scaffold only. |
| `experiments/` | Model / prompt / brief experiments run on the dev host. One dated folder per experiment. |
| `demos/` | Recorded runs worth keeping — transcripts, audio, notes. |
| `devlog/` | Living journal of development sessions — decisions, commands, outcomes, open threads, dated. |

## Where to start

1. Read `docs/PRD.md` — §0 (the spike), §3 (director/actor), §4 (object model) are the load-bearing ones.
2. Read `CLAUDE.md` — the working brief for AI-assisted development on this repo.
3. Read `spike/README.md` — the first real task.
